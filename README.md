## Technical Details

### Solana Integration

This project serves as an example of how to set up a frontend application that interacts with the Solana blockchain. It demonstrates:

- Connection to Solana RPC providers
- Wallet integration using `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`
- SPL Token interactions
- Transaction building and signing
- Program account management

### Smart Contract Interaction

The frontend interacts with a Solana Escrow program that enables:

- Creating offers with any SPL Token
- Taking offers by providing the requested tokens
- Managing offer lifecycle (create, take)

### Key Dependencies

- `@solana/web3.js`: Core Solana web3 functionality
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`: React hooks for Solana wallet integration
- `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`: UI components for wallet connection
- `@solana/spl-token`: SPL Token program interactions
- `@coral-xyz/anchor`: Framework for Solana program interaction

### Building for Production

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```

Using npm:
